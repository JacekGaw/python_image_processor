# Python image processor

This simple image processor takes provided photos and sort them reading exif data by created date. Also creates thumbnails for each one in separate folder.

My personal use case is when I am arriving from multi day hikking trip and have a bunch of photos from my camera that neeeds to be sorted and processed. 
... or sometimes when I am lazy and have one SD card for some long time inserted in my camera without coppying files after photoshoots ðŸ¤¡

#### How to use:
1. Create 'raw' folder in project directory,
2. Simply add all your JPG photos that you want to sort (Unfortunately id does not provide support for RAW files)
3. Run program

After that program will create "finals" folder with sortet photos, all in separate folders for every occured date. Also will create "thumbnails" flder with thumbnails in it.

#### Enjoy!
